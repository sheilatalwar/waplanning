<h2> Who should be the trustee for my children’s trust? </h2>


In some cases, you may have your children’s appointed guardian also be the trustee. However, it may be that you feel their guardian will be a wonderful parent, but may not have strong financial management skills. In that case, you can certainly appoint a different trusted friend/family member to be the trustee. Look for someone who has financial management skills, a level head, and the ability to work with your child’s guardian in a constructive manner. You should definitely ask your appointed trustee if they would be ok acting in this capacity -- they will need to manage your children’s trust and distribute funds as needed until the children come of age, so it is an important responsibility.
