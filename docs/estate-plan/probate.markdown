<h2> What is probate? Will my estate need to go through probate?</h2>
Probate is a legal process after a person’s death, where a person is appointed by the court to distribute the person’s assets, pay any outstanding bills/taxes, and eventually close the probate after they tie up loose ends. Your lawyer will help your family determine if your estate needs to go through probate and file the necessary paperwork. Probate is not an onerous process in Washington state, so this is not something to stress about.
