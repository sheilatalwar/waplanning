<h2> What information should I gather before meeting with a lawyer?   </h2>

Your lawyer will likely ask for an approximate total for your net worth. She will need to know this information because it will help her determine your strategy for minimizing estate taxes. You should have a general idea of “your estate”, which may include:

* Checking/Savings Accounts
* Mutual Funds
* Stocks
* Real Estate (in state and out of state)
* Jewelry
* Cars
* Debt (Mortgages, car loans, credit card debt, etc)


Note: If you are married and live in Washington State, all assets that you have acquired since marriage are jointly owned “community property” (with the exception of inherited assets). 

While this list seems daunting to compile, you should just keep a general idea noted down on paper before meeting with your lawyer. If you do not know the exact amount of an account or you can’t remember if you ever sold that mutual fund, that’s totally fine. Meet the lawyer with an approximate number in mind. The lawyer only really needs to know the estimated net worth, and if any property is out of state. Meeting a lawyer is like meeting a doctor. You don’t need to know everything before your appointment. You just need to be able to answer questions and listen to their advice. The lawyer will be available via email and phone, so you can always come back with detailed answers if need be. 
	
As for jewelry and small household items, these are optional to include in a will. A lawyer will most likely tell you to write out what you want given to whom on a list and attach it to the will documents. 

Frankly speaking, if you feel gathering all the details of your wedding jewelry that is packed away in a safety deposit box is hindering your progress , then skip this step. Your first and most important step is to get this will and trust created.  If certain assets are not specifically included in the will, they will simply be split between your inheritors (likely your children). 

Your entire focus should be creating a will and trust document and getting it signed as soon as possible. Don’t think of meeting the lawyer as preparation for a job interview. You are hiring a service. They are there to help and guide you on this complex process.
