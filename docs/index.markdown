<h2>Washington State Estate Planning 101  </h2>  
**A guide to estate planning for families in Washington State**  

| We are two women with professional backgrounds (business and law), who recently worked with estate attorneys to create estate plans for our respective families. We researched wills, credit trusts and children's trusts for our families quite extensively, and decided to post the knowledge we gained on this blog for others to leverage. We are not experts in this field, and highly recommend that you find an estate lawyer who can help you create an appropriate plan for your family's specific needs. We are open to feedback on our site, so please do [drop us a line](/waplanning/contact) if you have additions or modifications! | ![Authors](http:/waplanning.github.io/waplanning/assets/images/us.jpg)|
