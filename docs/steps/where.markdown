<h2> We created a will and trust with a lawyer, it is signed and the originals are in my hand. Now what? </h2>

* Put the originals in a drawer or readily accessible box in your home. Send your executor (and any backups) a message telling them the location of the documents. A safe is not ideal, unless every named person on your will has access. Your estate papers should not contain private information like a SSN or date of births. 
* Have your attorney send you a scanned file of the will and trust and send it to your executor, trustees, and guardians. 
* Notify your backup trustees and guardians (if any) by word of mouth what your intentions are. 
* If you donâ€™t already have one, create an excel sheet with a list of your accounts. Keep a copy with your estate documents and send a copy to your executor.
