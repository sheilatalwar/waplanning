The estate tax is a tax imposed on the transfer of property at the time of a personâ€™s death.The estate tax exemption for 2020 (meaning the amount you can pass from your estate without incurring any Washington Estate Tax liability) is $2,193,000. Estates above the exemption amount will likely incur estate tax ranging from [10 to 20 percent](https://dor.wa.gov/taxes-rates/other-taxes/estate-tax-tables) of your estate beyond the exemption. The estate tax exemption increases by a small adjustment every year. To minimize estate taxes, you should consider setting up a credit trust. The federal government also has an estate tax, but the threshold is significantly higher. The federal estate tax exemption is $11.58 million per individual.
