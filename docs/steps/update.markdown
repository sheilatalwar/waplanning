<h2> When and how should my estate plan be updated?</h2>

Generally, you should review your estate plan every three to five years. In addition, you should review it after major life events (divorce, death, birth, adoption, serious illness, child or grandchild turning 18, buying a home, major inheritance, etc). If you would like to make changes, you should contact your lawyer.
